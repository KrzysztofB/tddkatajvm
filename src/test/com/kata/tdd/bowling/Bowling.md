- 10x turn/frame to knock down all pins
- 2x try/throw/roll in each frame
- if not all pins in fram are down, total is sum of pins in each frame
- if in second roll in frame rest of pins is down
it's called "spare" next ball is added to frame
- if first roll in frame knocks down all pins, its the end of  frame
 and next two balls are added to frame
- Strike or spare in 10th frame gives extra 2 or 1 roll
